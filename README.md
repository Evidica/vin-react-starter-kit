The starter kit includes a working example app that puts all of the above to use.

## Get Started
1. **Initial Machine Setup**. First time running the starter kit? Then complete the [Initial Machine Setup](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-javascript-starter-kit#initial-machine-setup).
2. **Clone the project**. Run this on the command line in the directory where you'd like to get started: `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-react-starter-kit.git`. Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-react-starter-kit/releases) and unzip the files to your desired directory. The advantage to cloning is you can type `git pull` later and receive any updates to this starter kit.  
3. **Install Node packages.** `npm install`. 
4. **Run the example app**. Type `npm start -s` in the root of your project (same dir where you just ran `npm install`). This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, you'll want to keep the command line open at all times so that your code is rebuilt and tests run automatically every time you hit save. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which supresses unnecessary messages during the build.
5. **Review the example app.** This starter kit includes a working example app that calculates fuel savings. Note how all source code is placed under /src. Tests are placed alongside the file under test. The final built app is placed under /dist. These are the files you run in production.
6. **Delete the example app files.** Once you're comfortable with how the example app works, you can [delete those files and begin creating your own app](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-javascript-starter-kit#i-just-want-an-empty-starter-kit). You can always refer to this repo for the example app code that you deleted.

##Initial Machine Setup
It takes a few different tools to make Node run smoothly on Windows. **You only have to do this once**.  
1. **Install [Node](https://nodejs.org)**.  
2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.  
3. **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Browser-sync (and various other Node modules) rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.  
4. **Install C++ Compiler**. Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop. This C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and various other Node modules).  

##Folder Structure
**Note that the files that start with a dot below will be hidden by default in Windows.** [Here's how to see them](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7). Or type `ls -la` in Git Bash.

**/actions** - Redux actions. List of distinct actions that can occur in the app.  
**/businessLogic** - Plain old JavaScript objects. Strive to place as much of your code here as you can (easier to test, framework agnostic). These are like POCOs, but JS.  
**/components** - React components  
**/constants** - Application constants  
**/containers** - Redux app container  
**/reducers** - Redux reducers  
**/store** - Redux store configuration  
**/styles** - Stylesheets  
.babelrc - Babel configuration  
.editorconfig - Editor configuration. Enforces standards like tabs/spaces across editors  
.eslintrc - ESLint configuration  
package.json - npm configuration. Lists npm packages  
README.md - This file.  
server.js - Development webserver configuration using BrowserSync and Webpack  
webpack.config.js - Webpack config   

##FAQ
## Why does this exist?
I'm trying to assist with [JavaScript Fatigue](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.1luolx2ao). (Yes, the post claims "Boilerplates & generators are not the answer", but I'm convinced it's the best approach available for now. Building a real app with React requires a number of decisions. This starter kit codifies a long list of decisions that you no longer have to make to get rolling. It also saves you from the long, painful process of wiring it all together into an automated dev environment.

###What command line should I use?
This kit works on both the Windows DOS command line or in Git Bash on Windows. Git Bash is installed along with Git. 

### I just want an empty starter kit.
This starter kit includes an example app so you can see how everything hangs together on a real app. To create an empty project, you can delete the following:  
1. Components in src/components  
2. Styles in src/styles/styles.scss  
3. Delete files in src/businessLogic  

Don't want to use Redux? See the next question for some steps on removing Redux.

### Do I have to use Redux?
Nope. Redux is useful for applications with more complex data flows. If your app is simple, Redux may be overkill. In that case, you can uninstall Redux and delete the following folders:
* actions
* constants
* reducers
* containers

In main.js, reference your top level component (instead of Redux's root container at ./containers/root).

### Why are test files placed alongside the file under test (instead of centralized)? 
Streamlined automated testing is a core feature of this starter kit. All tests are placed in files that end in .spec.js. Spec files are placed in the same directory as the file under test. Why?
+ The existence of tests is highly visible. If a corresponding .spec file hasn't been created, it's obvious.
+ Easy to open since they're in the same folder as the file being tested.
+ Easy to create new test files when creating new source files.
+ Short import paths are easy to type and less brittle.
+ As files are moved, it's easy to move tests alongside.

### How do I view code coverage?
Code coverage is calculated and reported via Istanbul. To view your current code coverage, run `npm run open-coverage`. This will open a tab in your default browser which displays code coverage statistics. You can optionally update the npm script config to run your code coverage on the command line each time you hit save.

### How do I debug?
Since browsers don't currently support ES6, we're using Babel to compile our ES6 down to ES5. This means the code that runs in the browser looks different than what we wrote. But good news, a [sourcemap](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) is generated to enable easy debugging. This means your original JS source will be displayed in your browser's dev console. 
*Note:* When you run `npm start`, no JS is minified. Why? Because minifying slows the build. So JS is only minified when you run the `npm run build` script. See [more on building for production below](https://github.com/coryhouse/vin-javascript-starter-kit#how-do-i-deploy-this).

Also note that no actual physical files are written to the filesystem during the dev build. **For performance, all files exist in memory when served from the webpack server.**. Physical files are only written when you run `npm run build`.

**Tips for debugging via sourcemaps:**  
1. Browsers vary in the way they allow you to view the original source. Chrome automatically shows the original source if a sourcemap is available. Safari, in contrast, will display the minified source and you'll [have to cmd+click on a given line to be taken to the original source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19550060/how-do-i-toggle-source-mapping-in-safari-7).  
2. Do **not** enable serving files from your filesystem in Chrome dev tools. If you do, Chrome (and perhaps other browsers) may not show you the latest version of your code after you make a source code change. Instead **you must close the source view tab you were using and reopen it to see the updated source code**. It appears Chrome clings to the old sourcemap until you close and reopen the source view tab. To clarify, you don't have to close the actual tab that is displaying the app, just the tab in the console that's displaying the source file that you just changed.  
3. If the latest source isn't displaying the console, force a refresh. Sometimes Chrome seems to hold onto a previous version of the sourcemap which will cause you to see stale code.

### How do I deploy this?
Before committing, type `npm run build`. This will setup the project for production. It does the following:
* Minifies all JS
* Sets NODE_ENV to prod so that React is built in production mode
* Places the resulting built project files into /dist. (This is the folder you'll expose to the world).

### Why does the build use npm scripts instead of Gulp?
In short, Gulp is an unnecessary abstraction that creates more problems than it solves. [Here's why](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/).

### I'm getting an error when running npm install: Failed to locate "CL.exe"
On Windows, you need to install extra dependencies for browser-sync to build and install successfully. Follow the getting started steps above to assure you have the necessary dependencies on your machine.
