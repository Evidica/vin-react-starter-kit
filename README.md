# VinSolutions React Starter Kit
Starter kit for building a new React project at VinSolutions. This starter kit makes it easy to start a robust new project using modern tooling including:

* React for client-side components  
* Babel for compiling ES6 to ES5, so we can enjoy the new version of JavaScript today  
* Browserify for bundling all JS including npm packages for use in the browser  
* Mocha for automated tests   
* TrackJS for JS error tracking in production  
* ESLint for linting JS  
* SASS for styling  
* Gulp for automated builds. Gulp glues all this together in a handy one-liner  

The starter kit includes a working example app that puts all of the above to use.
